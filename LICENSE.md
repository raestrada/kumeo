## Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

## Key Terms of the GNU GPL v3.0

1. **Freedom to Use**: You may use the software for any purpose.

2. **Freedom to Study and Modify**: You may examine the source code, modify it, and run the modified program.

3. **Freedom to Share**: You may copy and distribute the unmodified software.

4. **Freedom to Improve and Redistribute**: You may distribute modified versions of the software.

## Requirements

When you distribute a covered work:

1. **License Preservation**: You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the original work.

2. **State Changes**: If you modify files, you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

3. **Source Code Availability**: If you distribute the program in object code form, you must also make the source code available.

4. **Same License**: Any modified version you distribute must be licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0.

5. **No Additional Restrictions**: You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.

## Patents

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's patent claims to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

## Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
