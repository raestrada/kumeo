# Kumeo - Elevator Pitch

## 30-Second Version

Kumeo is a declarative language for orchestrating distributed agent workflows. It allows teams to define complex interactions between heterogeneous agents—including LLMs, ML models, and human experts—through a simple, event-driven syntax. By compiling to Rust and deploying to Kubernetes, Kumeo provides enterprise-grade performance and scalability. It's the missing link for organizations wanting to build robust, multi-agent systems without getting lost in implementation details.

## 60-Second Version

**Problem:** Today's AI systems are siloed. Organizations struggle to connect different models and agents into coherent workflows, leading to fragmented architectures and wasted potential.

**Solution:** Kumeo is a declarative language for orchestrating distributed agent workflows. With just a few lines of code, you can define how LLMs, ML models, and human experts collaborate through events. Our compiler transforms these definitions into high-performance Rust code that deploys natively to Kubernetes.

**Benefits:**
- **Simplicity**: Express complex agent interactions in a readable, declarative syntax
- **Performance**: Compiled to Rust for minimal overhead and maximum throughput
- **Scalability**: Native Kubernetes integration for enterprise-grade reliability
- **Flexibility**: Supports any agent type—from OpenAI/Ollama LLMs to custom ML models and human experts

**Differentiator:** Unlike existing workflow tools that require separate integration code, Kumeo unifies the definition, execution, and monitoring of multi-agent systems in one cohesive platform.

## One-Liner

"Kumeo is the declarative language that lets you orchestrate LLMs, ML models, and human experts into powerful, event-driven workflows—compiled to Rust and deployed to Kubernetes for enterprise-grade performance."
